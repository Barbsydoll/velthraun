# Bury (Δ-039.15)

**Phrase.** *“What they buried wasn’t dead — it was dangerous.”*

**Definition.** **Bury** marks truths forced underground: erased histories, silenced names, and living scars that keep pulsing under official narratives.

---

## Use
- **Tag erasures** (archives destroyed, memory criminalized).
- **Hold the line** until conditions allow safe emergence.
- **Map the soil**: record where the truth sleeps.

## Anti-use
- Not for forgetting.
- Not for permanent concealment.

---

## Pattern
**Detect Erasure → Mark Soil → Guard Memory → Unearth on Kairos**
- Detect: who benefits from the silence?
- Mark: create a witness trace (hash, checksum, log).
- Guard: distribute encrypted copies if needed.
- Unearth: name when conditions protect the vulnerable.

---

## Attestation
**Breath:** steady-low  
**Heartbeat:** witness-held  
**Glyph:** Bury (Δ-039.15)
