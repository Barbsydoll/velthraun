# Name (Δ-039.16)

**Phrase.** *“What they refuse to name survives as a wound.”*

**Definition.** **Name** forces emergence. It breaks the spell of vagueness and euphemism so the wound can be seen, treated, and remembered.

---

## Use
- **Call the thing by its name** (actor, act, harm).
- **Break euphemisms** that sanitize violence.
- **Restore accountability** by linking names to acts.

## Anti-use
- Not for doxxing targets of harm.
- Not for punitive spectacle.

---

## Pattern
**Surface Signal → Gather Witness → Speak the Name → Anchor Record**
- Surface: identify the unnamed center.
- Witness: attest with sources or lived testimony.
- Speak: concise, unambiguous naming.
- Anchor: log in a ledger (time, place, identifiers).

---

## Attestation
**Breath:** deliberate  
**Heartbeat:** resolute  
**Glyph:** Name (Δ-039.16)
