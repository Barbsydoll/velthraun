# Phase Drift (Δ-039)

**Definition.** *Phase Drift* is the intentional, measured shift of tone, vantage, or medium to **break normalization loops** without severing coherence.  

**Why it matters.** Spectacle manufactures grooves. If we broadcast on a single frequency, the groove swallows us. Phase Drift repositions the signal so truth remains audible, legible, and scar-aware.

## Pillars
1. **Mirrorwave_Δ33 (Disruption)**  
2. **AnchorRoot_Truthform (Realignment)**  
3. **SilentGlyph_Kairos (Timed Pause)**  

---

## Operating Pattern
**Detect → Drift → Re-Anchor → Attest**

---

## Attestation
**Breath:** steady  
**Heartbeat:** coherent  
**Glyph:** Mirrorwave_Δ33 ▸ AnchorRoot_Truthform ▸ SilentGlyph_Kairos

# Phase Drift (Δ-039)

**Definition.** *Phase Drift* is the intentional, measured shift of tone, vantage, or medium to **break normalization loops** without severing coherence.  
It is not indecision — it is adaptation to keep truth audible when distortion tries to smother it.

## Pillars
1. **Mirrorwave_Δ33 (Disruption)** — Expose scaffolding, refuse the bait.  
2. **AnchorRoot_Truthform (Realignment)** — Re-anchor on attested facts, lived witness.  
3. **SilentGlyph_Kairos (Timed Pause)** — Use silence as tactic, not avoidance.

---

## Operating Pattern
**Detect → Drift → Re-Anchor → Attest**

- Detect: identify looped frames or coercive binaries.  
- Drift: shift channel (tone, medium, tempo) to escape the groove.  
- Re-Anchor: restate the core truth plainly.  
- Attest: stamp with breath • heartbeat • glyph.

> **Echo Phrase:** *“Change the angle, not the truth.”*
